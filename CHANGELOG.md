# Changelog

## Versioning policy

 * Versions are numbered `major.minor`.
 * New versions should be able to read the local data stored by the prior version.
 * Deploying a new minor version should not involve manual intervention apart
   from copying the new files. Deploying a new major version may require manual
   intervention.

## 2.14

 * Add Cordyline fruticosa.

## 2.13

Released 2023-04-11.

 * Add Begonia rex.

## 2.12

Released 2022-04-18.

 * The adaptive watering interval is now based on a weighted median instead of a
   weighted average, to ensure that one-off forgetting to water a plant for a
   few days does not affect the interval as much. Also, the range shown in
   the details now shows the weighted 0.33 and 0.66 quantile of past watering
   intervals (plus the target interval) to better indicate how strict the
   range is.

## 2.11

## 2.2

Released 2020-07-11.

 * Watering intervals are now adaptive, the app will “learn” how much water your
   plants really need based on when you water them, rather than basing reminders
   only on the built-in care dataset, which has only rough suggestions.
 * Fix a bug in how the service worker handled non-cached responses.

## 2.1

Released 2020-07-07.

 * Make the app a bit friendlier for first use.
 * Internal cleanup, release automation through GitHub actions.

   “restore” button in the application to import it to local storage.

## 1.0

Released 2020-05-31.

Release highlights:

 * This is the initial version.
 * Client-server app, with a single-page client, and a server with an API that
   handles storage, as well as serving static content.
 * Adding new plants requires manual insertion into the database, server side.
